How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bugg that was introduced?

Honestly, it was really difficult to spot the bug using diff because I couldn't tell where one version started and ended.  I ended up using a different diff tool

***
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros are that your history will be more logical and easily readable.
The cons - not having a backed up copy if something unexpected happens that causes you to lose work (i.e. computer or app crashes)

***
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because a change can involve multiple files.  

***
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will show commit history of a repository
git diff will show differences between 2 commits

***
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because it allows me to go back to a previous state if the change I made breaks something
